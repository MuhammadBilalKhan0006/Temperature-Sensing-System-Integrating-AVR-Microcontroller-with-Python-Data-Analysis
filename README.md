Objectives:






		 This assignment basically revolves around the concepts of serial communication between the microcontroller and the PC. The assignment also holds the part where we have to collect the data from a sensor named LM35. Moreover, the assignment also introduces us to some simple parts of python language. The concepts that are involved in the python are:
•	Introduction to libraries of Python
•	Learn how to transmit data using python to the AVR.
•	Plotting the data received from the atmega16a on the PC.
•	Linear regression




The Lm35 sensor gives a fluctuating voltages in range of mili volts and then we have to calibrate that voltages to the integer values in centigrade and display that values seven segment. Moreover, we also use simple if and else in the python segment to display the max and minimum value depending on the requirements.




Conclusion:
		Reading temperature from LM35 was quite easy task, and then taking average was a little bit confusing. Moreover, I got to learn some commands of python that were easy as we have studied C/C++ already. In this assignment the hardware part was not a huge task, as it holds a limited number of components that we used.
